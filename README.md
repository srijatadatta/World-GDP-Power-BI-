# World-GDP-Power-BI-
I have used Power Bi for creating an interactive dashboard using World GDP Dataset

I utilized a comprehensive World GDP dataset, which included historical GDP values for various countries spanning several years. This dataset was sourced from reliable economic databases and governmental sources to ensure accuracy and reliability. This Power BI project provided a comprehensive analysis of global GDP trends, utilizing various visualization techniques to present insights effectively. By enabling interactivity and customization through slicers, users can explore the data dynamically, gaining valuable insights into the economic landscape on a global scale.
